### Hello :vulcan_salute:

:mask: It's actually me [(@kosalanuwan)](https://twitter.com/kosalanuwan/). I interact with GitHub daily, [so why not use it for everything else](https://kosalanuwan.github.io/journal/productivity/). I’m that nerd :nerd_face:! GitHub used to be my unicorn, and now it is my bitch, with :heart: of course.

- :telescope: I’m currently working on stuff like [.NET Core]() Migrations, [GitHub Pages](https://kosalanuwan.github.io/jekyll-otto-theme/) and [Azure Serverless](https://speaker-deck.io/kosalanuwan/) amongst other 20+ projects
- :seedling: I’m currently learning stuff like [Devcontainers](https://github.com/devcontainers/), [Azure Architecture](), and non-techy stuff like [Fiction Writing]()
- :beers: I’m looking to collaborate on [Inner Sourcing]() and Technology Upgrades/Migrations
<!--
- :thinking: I’m looking for help with _Industry Practices on Product Engineering_ for [slasscom/bootcamp-curriculum](https://github.com/SLASSCOM/slasscom-bootcamp-curriculum)
-->
- :neckbeard: I'm a huge @GitHub nerd!
- :green_book: I use markdown to take notes on almost everything
- :books: I like reading on [Audible]() and it's awesome, plus
- :clapper: I like making [Playlists on YouTube]()
- :speech_balloon: Ask me anything about [.NET](), [Javascript](), [GitHub](), and all things OSS, Clean Code and Clean Architecture, _BUT NOT Java or Machine Learning_
- :call_me_hand: How to reach me: [via LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kosalanuwan/), or [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/kosalanuwan), or [Ask me anything on GitHub](https://github.com/kosalanuwan/ama/)
- :grin: Pronouns: KP/He/Him/His
- :zap: Fun fact: All things [behind Movies and TV Series]() from SyFy to Biography to Docuseries
